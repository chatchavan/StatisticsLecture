Plotting the results of the linear model

                m1$coefficients[1] + m1$coefficients[3])

```

```{r}
coded <- model.matrix(~Group, data = data)
print(coded)
```

```{r}
rafalib::imagemat(coded, main ="Model matrix")
```

Let's look at the linear model again:
```{r}
summary(m1)
```
```{r}

anova_result <- anova(m1)
str(anova_result)
```


**Interpretation:** Comparing between the two models: 

* Null model (\\(H_0\\)): the grand mean adequately represents the data
* Alternative model (\\(H_1\\)): three means adequately represents the data

Assuming that \\((H_0\\)) is true, the data doesn't quite compatible with \\(H_0\\), *F*(`r anova_result$Df[1]`, `r anova_result$Df[2]`) = `r anova_result[["F value"]][1]`, *p* <.001. Therefore, we choose to beleive in \\(H_1\\).

(Exact *p* = = `r anova_result[["Pr(>F)"]][1]`)

We also know the location of each mean from the coefficients. What we do not yet know is whether the three means differs significantly or not.


# Checking the differences: pairwise comparison
We can compare pairs that we are interested in.

If we don't have any plan, we can compare three hypotheses simultaneously:
* \\(H_{0, 1}\\): The difference between mean of Group A and Group B is equal to zero: \\(\\mu_A - \\mu_B = 0\\) 
* \\(H_{0, 2}\\): \\(\\mu_A - \\mu_C = 0\\) 
* \\(H_{0, 3}\\): \\(\\mu_B - \\mu_C = 0\\) 
```{r}
group_pairwise <- glht(m1, linfct = mcp(Group = "Tukey"))
# glht: Generalized Linear Hypothesis Tests
# linfct: LINear FunCTion; mcp: Multiple ComParison

summary(group_pairwise)
```

We can plot the differences out. 
```{r}
group_pairwise_t <- tidy(confint(group_pairwise))
group_pairwise_t %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = paste(lhs, "==", rhs))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +     # reference line
  geom_point(aes(y = estimate)) +                  # point estimate of the difference
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0) + # 95% CI of the difference
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Hypothesis") +
  ylab("Estimate of the difference")
```

**Interpretation:** In the plot above, we can see that the difference between C vs. B and B vs. A are pretty close to zero. The 95% confidence interval of the C vs. B pair actually crosses zero. Therefore, we'd interpret that the difference between C vs. B is unlikely. 

For B vs. A, although the confidence interval doesn't include zero, it's pretty near. At this point, we should use the domain knowledge in our judgement. For example, if the difference is in terms of task completion time in seconds. The difference around 0.15 - 2.6 second wouldn't be a big deal. However, if the data is the difference between cost in million Euros, the difference between 0.15 -2.6 millions would be more notable.

The interpretation of C vs. A is left as your exercise.


# Checking the differences: planned contrast
But if we have planned our comparison beforehand. For example, if A is the baseline, and B, C are treatments conditions. We want to compare the following pairs

* \\(H_{0, 1}\\): Baseline vs. treatments \\(\\mu_A - \\mu_BC = 0\\) 
* \\(H_{0, 2}\\): Compare between the two treatments \\(\\mu_B - \\mu_C = 0\\) 
```{r}
group_contrast <- glht(m1, 
  linfct = mcp(
    Group = c(
      "A - (B + C) = 0",     # null hypothesis 1
      "B - C = 0"            # null hypothesis 2
)))
print(summary(group_contrast))

# calculate confidence interval for each of the hypotheses
group_contrast_t <- tidy(confint(group_contrast))

group_contrast_t %>% 
  
  # add readable hypothesis column
  mutate(Hypothesis = paste(lhs, "==", rhs)) %>% 
  
  # reverse order to counter the effect of the following coord_flip()
  mutate(Hypothesis = factor(Hypothesis, levels = (rev(Hypothesis)))) %>%
  
  # plot
  ggplot(aes(x = Hypothesis)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +     # reference line
  geom_point(aes(y = estimate)) +                  # point estimate of the difference
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0) + # 95% CI of the difference
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Hypothesis") +
  ylab("Estimate of the difference")
```

In general, good experimental designs have planned contrasts in advance, thus avoid testing too many hypotheses simultaneously.

```{r}
summary(glht(m1, 
  linfct = mcp(
    Group = c(
      "A - (B + C) = 0"# null hypothesis 1
))))
```



# Your turn

```{r}
data_game <- read.csv("../data/GameControllers.csv")
```

Inspection plot of the data
```{r}
plot_grid({ 
  data_game %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Device, y = Time)) +
    geom_beeswarm() + 
    expand_limits(y = 0) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
  },{
  data_game %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Device, y = Time)) +
    stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", shape = 18, size = 3) + 
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = "errorbar", width = 0) + 
    ylab("Mean(Time) and 95% CI") +
    expand_limits(y = 0)
  },
  nrow = 1)
```

**Interpretation:** Write down your preliminary expectation based the graphs above.


Fitting linear model
```{r}
data_game$Device <- as.factor(data_game$Device)  # TODO ensure that the Device is a factor variable
m2 <- lm(Time ~ Device, data = data_game)
anova(m2)
```

Conduct a planned contrast by uncommenting the code below and fill in specification for the following hypotheses:

* \\(H_{0, 1}\\): There's no difference between desktop input devices (mouse and trackpad) and gaming devices (joystick, Wiimote, Kinect)
* \\(H_{0, 2}\\): There's no difference between mouse and trackpad.
* \\(H_{0, 3}\\): There's no difference between conventional joystick and motion controllers (Wiimote and Kinect).
* \\(H_{0, 4}\\): There's no difference between Wiimote and Kinect

```{r}
m2.contrast <- glht(m2, linfct = mcp(Device = 
  c(
    "(Mouse + Trackpad) - (Joystick + Wiimote + Kinect) == 0",
    "Mouse - Trackpad == 0",
    "Joystick - (Wiimote + Kinect) == 0",
    "Wiimote - Kinect == 0"
    )))

m2.contrast %>% 
  confint() %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = paste(lhs, "==", rhs))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(y = estimate)) +            
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0) +
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Hypothesis") +
  ylab("Estimate of the difference")
```

**Interpretation:** TODO: write your interpretation of the planned contrast analysis here.
